## Assessing the Variety of a Two-Parent Miscanthus Mapping Population

This is my Dissertation project completed as part of my Data Science MSc, completed September 2019. Note that it was written in Welsh and then translated to English for marking; therefore the English copy of the dissertation does not contain any images.

*Summary*
Attitudes towards the use of fossil fuels are quickly changing for the worst as people learn and understand the effect that burning fossil fuels has on our world. One proposed alternative to their use is development of biofuel. This paper analyses a dataset spanning three years of measurements on Miscanthus plants grown in Aberystwyth, Wales. It analyses the behaviour of 105 genotypes of Miscanthus and develops a linear model which will predict the crop of each genotype by using the plants' phenotypical properties. The predictions of the linear model are used to determine which genotypes should be further developed in order to improve crop quality and yield. The results of the assessment of variation in the Miscanthus plants in this paper suggest that the best genotype of Miscanthus for growth as biofuel in a climate similar to Aberystwyth will flower late in the year, with high transect density, tall stems and leaves located high up the stem.

*Technologies Used*
- R
- Linear models
- Data Visualisation
- LaTeX

*Files*
- **Data_cleanup_2011.R**, **Data_cleanup_2012.R** and **Data_cleanup_2013.R** are the scripts used to clean the raw data, renaming columns and dealing with missing data etc. The output of the cleaning are the files ending in **_clean.csv**. The script **read_in_clean_data.R** is used in order to read in the CSV files for investigation.
